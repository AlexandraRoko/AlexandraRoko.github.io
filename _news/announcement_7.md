Finally official and in the bag: I am going to visiting [Prof. Michael Macy](https://sociology.cornell.edu/michael-macy) and his [Social Dynamics Lab](https://sdl.as.cornell.edu/) at the Cornell University from August to December 2025. More than excited about this stay. Feel free to reach out if you are in Ithaca!
