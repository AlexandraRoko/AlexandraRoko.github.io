I spent the last 5 months at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, visiting the Department of Sociology and Information Science hosted by [Prof. Michael Macy](https://sociology.cornell.edu/michael-macy) and the [Social Dynamics Lab](https://sdl.as.cornell.edu/). I got the chance to present at [René Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com/) Future of Learning Lab as well as at the Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (IET) Interdisciplinary Theme Seminar Series hosted at the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business. I also audited courses in Computational Social Science, AI in organisations, and theories on firm stategies and innovation.
