Hello and welcome to my website! 

I'm a trained Social Data Scientist (@Oxford) and have a background in Public Policy (@Berlin), Physics (@Heidelberg) and Geography (@Heidelberg), too. Currently, I am doing my PhD studies in Computational Social Sciences/Analytical Sociology at the Institute for Analytical Sociology, LinkÃ¶ping University, Sweden.

My past projects have combined different methods, such as natural language processing, social network analysis, and agent-based modelling, to study attention dynamics in the German parliament, how nations digitize over time, and how gender shapes online interaction. In my dissertation, I focus on the emergence and reproduction of occupational gender segregation --- using the amazing Swedish full-population register data and computational methods to get at the mechanisms that occupational sorting in the labour market. Furthermore, I have a project on scholary mobility and how a scholar's embedding ultimatly sturctures their opportunity space. 

When Iâ€™m not coding, reading or writing, you can find me hiking on Swedenâ€™s lakeshore trails or growing plants. Feel free to [download my CV]({{ "/assets/pdf/Rottenkolber_CV_Website.pdf" | relative_url }}) or
