Hello! I am PhD Student in Computational Social Sciences/Analytical Sociology at the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias), Linköping University, Sweden. In my thesis
In my past work, I have used a variety of methodological approaches — ranging from natural language processing to network analysis — to study attention dynamics in parliaments, the digital development of nations, as well as gendered patterns of behaviour online. In my PhD I plan to extend and build on this existing work.
